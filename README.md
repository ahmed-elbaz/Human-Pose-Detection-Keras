# Human-Pose-Detection-Keras

## Introduction
MPII Human Pose dataset is a state of the art benchmark for evaluation of articulated human pose estimation. The dataset includes around 25K images containing over 40K people with annotated body joints. The images were systematically collected using an established taxonomy of every day human activities.

We will build a deep learning based model that can estimate the activity category assigned to each image ( For example if the image is under: bicycling or dancing ... etc).

For more details regarding the dataset you can check the following link http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/#download

## Repository contents
1. **Human Pose Detection** PDF file that includes summary of the work done, evaluation metrics and limitations. 
2. **Loading_Images_(Read,_Resize_&_Save_Images_to_NPY_File)** notebook is for reading, resizing and saving images in lower-sized format. 
3. **Annotations_preprocessing** notebook is used for labels extraction from annotations. 
4. **Model_selection_(VGG16_&_CNN_&_Xception)** notebook is for model selection and results obtained.
